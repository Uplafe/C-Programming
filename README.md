## ðŸ›’ Simple Calculator

**Description:**  
A program that calculates discounts based on membership type and total purchase.

### ðŸ’» Code
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
int a, b;
int op_choice;
 printf("Enter 1 for Addition, 2 for Subtraction, 3 for Multiplication:");
  scanf("%d", &op_choice);
 switch (op_choice)
 {
     case 1:
      printf("Input the value of a(a+b=?):");
       scanf("%d",&a);
      printf("Input the value of b (a+b=?):");
       scanf("%d",&b);
      printf("The sum of %d and %d is %d",a,b,a+b);
      break;

     case 2:
      printf("Input the value of a(a-b=?):");
       scanf("%d",&a);
      printf("Input the value of b (a-b=?):");
       scanf("%d",&b);
      printf("The sum of %d and %d is %d",a,b,a-b);
      break;

     case 3:
      printf("Input the value of a(a x b=?):");
       scanf("%d",&a);
      printf("Input the value of b (a x b=?):");
       scanf("%d",&b);
      printf("The sum of %d and %d is %d",a,b,a*b);
      break;
      
     default:
     
     printf("Error");
 }
 
    return 0;
}
