## ðŸ›’ Shopping Discount System

**Description:**  
A program that calculates discounts based on membership type and total purchase.

### ðŸ’» Code
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char member;
    float amount, discount = 0.0;

    printf("Enter membership type (G for Gold, S for Silver, N for None): ");
    scanf(" %c", &member);
    printf("Enter total purchase amount: ");
    scanf("%f", &amount);

    if (member == 'G' && amount > 500)
        discount = amount * 0.2;
    else if (member == 'S' && amount > 300)
        discount = amount * 0.1;

    printf("Discount: %.2f\n", discount);
    printf("Final amount: %.2f\n", amount - discount);

    return 0;
}
